Project Name: Linear Regression Bike Sharing Assignment
Problem Statement:
A US bike-sharing provider, BoomBikes, has experienced significant revenue declines due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. In an effort to sustain itself, the company aims to understand the post-quarantine demand for shared bikes. By doing so, BoomBikes seeks to prepare for future market conditions, differentiate itself from competitors, and maximize profits.

General Information:
Background: BoomBikes faces revenue challenges amidst the COVID-19 pandemic and seeks to anticipate post-quarantine demand for shared bikes.
Business Problem: Determine the significant variables influencing the demand for shared bikes and develop strategies to meet customer expectations and demand levels.
Dataset: The dataset used contains relevant independent variables to predict bike demand post-quarantine.
Technologies Used:
numpy version: 1.24.3
pandas version: 2.0.3
seaborn version: 0.12.2
matplotlib version: 3.7.2
scikit-learn (sklearn) version: 1.3.0
statsmodels version: 0.14.0

Conclusions:
Identification of significant variables: Through analysis, key variables impacting bike demand post-quarantine were identified.
As per the Final Model, the top 3 Predictor Variables that are needed for the prediction purposes are:
Wheather Situation
Season
Year

Model performance: The developed model effectively describes the relationship between independent variables and bike demand.
Final Comparision of the result
Train R^2 :0.7642
Train Adjusted R^2 0.7587
Test R^2 :0.7988
Test Adjusted R^0.785.
The model seems to have predicted pretty well.

Business strategy implications: Insights gained from the analysis can inform strategic decisions to meet customer demand effectively.
Future considerations: Recommendations for further analysis or model refinement to enhance predictive accuracy and strategic planning.
